# Business Problem
How can BlueStone Realty Inc. increase the revenue by at least 16% in 5 months by analyzing the effect of house remodeling on the sale price and implementing predictive analytics?

(According to our scenario) BlueStone Realty Inc. is a realtor company that has a large business in Ames, Iowa. During July 2010, BlueStone Realty Inc. takes notice that the actual revenue is 4,000,000 Dollars less than the budget revenue.
There are 1459 houses in the current market. The company has a budget of 25,000,000 Dollars to buy-sell houses for the rest of the year of 2010. BlueStone Realty Inc. wants to

1) Have a strategy to increase revenues by at least 16% until the end of the year.

2) Determine the top houses which are expected to provide the most revenue opportunities.

To identify a strategy for more revenues and to determine the target houses, we will analyze the dataset that has the values of 1460 sold houses during the 5 previous years (January 2006 - July 2010) and will develop a predictive model.
Our main aim is to identify the revenue opportunities when we remodel the houses before selling them. We will analyze the difference in sale prices between the newly-remodeled houses and non-newly-remodeled houses. With respect to our model, we will identify the top houses that have estimated prices in a total of 25,000,000 Dollars. We will calculate that if we sell these target houses by remodeling them, how much more revenue we will gain.

# What will we do?
1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will apply feature engineering, business analytics, data visualization, and statistics to have a better understanding of the features involved in our data and especially will focus on the features that have the highest correlation towards SalePrice.

2) Regression Analysis: We will develop a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a possible SalePrice of the houses.

3) Business Intelligence Analysis: We will implement the predictive model on the test data (that shows 1459 houses in the current market) to help BlueStone Realty Inc. to make more data-driven decisions.
